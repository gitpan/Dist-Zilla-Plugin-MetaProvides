Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MetaProvides

1.14000000 2012-02-07T08:45:13Z
 [Features]
 - Reverted all non-documentation changes since 1.13x. Handling this in the
   role level was a dumb idea anyway.

1.13000001 2012-02-04T09:04:53Z
 [Documentation]
 - Improve documentation of skip_underscores and meta_noindex at the more
   foward-facing sites.

1.13000000 2012-02-04T07:35:05Z
 [Features]
 - Add a provisional filter that eliminates X::_y form namespaces ( a
   hiding convention ), enabled by default. Toggle skip_underscore to
   change. Thanks XDG/David Golden for reporting this in rt#74675.

1.12060501 2011-04-08T13:44:56Z

 [Packaging]

 - Made critic happy and stricter.

 [Tests]
 - add CPAN::Changes tests.
 - remove portability tests.

1.12044806 2010-11-06T18:20:55Z
 - A little bit more testing of the codebase, tests should be now
   comprehensive enough to detect most change-bugs.

1.12044803 2010-11-06T15:26:58Z
 - Build ourself using MetaNoIndex to hide corpus/ crap.
 - Add MetaNoIndex to suggest lists.
 - Fix tests not to fail when there is no MetaNoIndex.
 - PerlTidy allover.

1.12044518 2010-11-04T06:32:54Z
 - Spliced Test deps into its own module.
 - Shipped work behind _try_regen_metadata to
   Dist::Zilla::Util::EmulatePhase
 - meta_noindex is now *ON* by default. This behavioural change is reason
   for Bumping the minor to 12. Rationale: If you're using MetaNoIndex and
   this module, then you want things to get skipped. With provides =>, cpan
   won't do any indexing itself, so no_index in the data does nothing. So,
   this module brings that power back to life by implementing it manually.
 - Add thanks while I remember.

1.11044405 2010-11-02T17:04:51Z
 - Drop silly extra depends that sneaked in. It was hobbitses, and they are
   pesky.

1.11044404 2010-11-02T16:25:56Z
 - Upgrade to recent @KENTNL changes ( remove inc/ and xt/ from source
   tree, relocate perlcritic.rc )
 - Now have a convenience function, usable by all consuming roles that
   permit filtering packages that match criteira added to MetaNoIndex. Once
   your role uses this function, the attribute also bolted on by this
   change ( meta_noindex = 1 ) will control this behaviour. Thanks to
   xdg/David Golden for this suggestion.

1.11034201 2010-07-24T13:35:56Z
 - Forked into 4 smaller dists to reduce the installation overheads.
 - Mostly so that people who want Metaprovides::Package don't have to
   install MooseX::Declare and friends. ::Plugin::MetaProvides,
   ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package, ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Class,
   ::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile

1.10034117 2010-07-24T05:37:49Z
 - Dropped xt/author/kwalitee.t to avoid the needless dep. ( Kwalitee Test
   plugin doesn't have this issue )

1.10027802 2010-05-22T13:08:02Z
 - Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL ( Yeilding more accurate t/
   depends )
 - Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour of the more reliable and
   more generic =inc::lib

1.10027518 2010-05-20T05:33:10Z
 - Upgraded tests to Dist::Zilla 2.x. ( should resolve rt #56482 ) ( Thanks
   to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
 - Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12T06:17:57Z
 - Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes problems for some.
   Apparently deping on something that may or may not be in core which may
   or may not be in core later is a bad thing.
 - Added CompileTests
 - Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.

1.10000417 2009-08-28T04:52:32Z
 - Moved the tests around.

1.0920015 2009-07-19T15:31:07Z
 - Now eating own dog food.
 - Scan *.pm|*.pod so that .pod files index properly
 - Only scan lib/
