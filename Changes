Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MetaProvides

1.12044806 2010-11-07 07:20:55 Pacific/Auckland
          A little bit more testing of the codebase,
            tests should be now comprehensive enough to
            detect most change-bugs.

1.12044803 2010-11-07 04:26:58 Pacific/Auckland
          Build ourself using MetaNoIndex to hide corpus/ crap.
          Add MetaNoIndex to suggest lists.
          Fix tests not to fail when there is no MetaNoIndex.
          PerlTidy allover.

1.12044518 2010-11-04 19:32:54 Pacific/Auckland
          Spliced Test deps into its own module.
          Shipped work behind _try_regen_metadata to Dist::Zilla::Util::EmulatePhase
          meta_noindex is now *ON* by default. This behavioural change is reason for Bumping the minor to 12.
          Rationale:
            If you're using MetaNoIndex and this module, then you want things to get skipped.
            With provides =>, cpan won't do any indexing itself, so no_index in the data does nothing.
            So, this module brings that power back to life by implementing it manually.
          Add thanks while I remember.

          Drop silly extra depends that sneaked in. It was hobbitses, and they are pesky.

1.11044404 2010-11-03 05:25:56 Pacific/Auckland
          Upgrade to recent @KENTNL changes ( remove inc/ and xt/ from source tree, relocate perlcritic.rc )
          Now have a convenience function, usable by all consuming roles that permit filtering packages
            that match criteira added to MetaNoIndex. Once your role uses this function, the attribute
            also bolted on by this change ( meta_noindex = 1 ) will control this behaviour.
            Thanks to xdg/David Golden for this suggestion.

1.11034201 2010-07-25 01:35:56 Pacific/Auckland
          Forked into 4 smaller dists to reduce the installation overheads.
          Mostly so that people who want Metaprovides::Package don't have to install MooseX::Declare and friends.
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::Class
            ::Plugin::MetaProvides::FromFile

1.10034117 2010-07-24 17:37:49 Pacific/Auckland

          Dropped xt/author/kwalitee.t to avoid the needless dep.
           ( Kwalitee Test plugin doesn't have this issue )

1.10027802 2010-05-23 01:08:02 Pacific/Auckland
          Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL
            ( Yeilding more accurate t/ depends )
          Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour
            of the more reliable and more generic
            =inc::lib

1.10027518 2010-05-20 17:33:10 Pacific/Auckland
          Upgraded tests to Dist::Zilla 2.x. ( should resolve rt #56482 )
            ( Thanks to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
          Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12 06:17:57 UTC
          Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes
           problems for some. Apparently deping on something that
           may or may not be in core which may or may not be in core
           later is a bad thing.
          Added CompileTests
          Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.

1.10000417 2009-08-28 04:52:32 UTC
          Moved the tests around.
          More tests.
          All versions now maxing out to encourage upgrading.
          Moved to relative dating scheme
          Tighter DogFeed Loopback in buildsystem.
          Critic'd.
          Documentation Upped on the plugs.

1.0920022 2009-07-19 22:52:48 UTC
          Moved Documentation to a .pm
              file to satisfy Module::Build

1.0920015 2009-07-19 15:31:07 UTC
          Now eating own dog food.
          Scan *.pm|*.pod so that .pod files index properly
          Only scan lib/
          Fixed Bug with META's having ; in them.

1.0920012 2009-07-19 12:24:43 UTC
