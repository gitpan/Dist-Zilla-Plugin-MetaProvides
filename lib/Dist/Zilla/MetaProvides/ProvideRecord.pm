=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::MetaProvides::ProvideRecord - Data Management Record for MetaProvider::Provides Based Class

=head1 VERSION

version 1.12044803

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 version

See L<Dist::Zilla::MetaProvides::Types/ModVersion>

=head2 module

The String Name of a fully qualified module to be reported as
included in the distribution.

=head2 file

The String Name of the file as to be reported in the distribution.

=head2 parent

A L<Dist::Zilla::MetaProvides::Types/ProviderObject>, mostly to get Zilla information
and accessors from L<Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 copy_into C<( \%provides_list )>

Populate the referenced C<%provides_list> with data from this Provide Record object.

This is called by the  L<Dist::Zilla::Role::MetaProvider::Provider> Role.

This is very convenient if you have an array full of these objects, for you can just do

    my %discovered;
    for ( @array ) {
       $_->copy_into( \%discovered );
    }

and C<%discovered> will be populated with relevant data.
